## Resources
### Tools
- [arriba | GitHub](https://github.com/suhrig/arriba/) - *Fast and accurate gene fusion detection from RNA-Seq data*
- [STAR-Fusion | GitHub](https://github.com/STAR-Fusion/STAR-Fusion) - *STAR-Fusion is a component of the [Trinity Cancer Transcriptome Analysis Toolkit (CTAT)](https://github.com/NCIP/Trinity_CTAT/wiki). STAR-Fusion uses the STAR aligner to identify candidate fusion transcripts supported by Illumina reads. STAR-Fusion further processes the output generated by the STAR aligner to map junction reads and spanning reads to a reference annotation set.*
- [National Cancer Informatics Program | GitHub](https://github.com/NCIP) ([datascience.cancer.gov](http://ncip.nci.nih.gov/)) - *The National Cancer Institute (NCI) coordinates the United States National Cancer Program and is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which is one of eleven agencies that are part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The NCI conducts and supports research, training, health information dissemination, and other activities related to the causes, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer; the supportive care of cancer patients and their families; and cancer survivorship.*
    - [Trinity CTAT | GitHub](https://github.com/NCIP/Trinity_CTAT/) - *The Trinity Cancer Transcriptome Analysis Toolkit (CTAT) aims to provide tools for leveraging RNA-Seq to gain insights into the biology of cancer transcriptomes. Bioinformatics tool support is provided for mutation detection, fusion transcript identification, de novo transcript assembly of cancer-specific transcripts, lincRNA classification, and foreign transcript detection (viruses, microbes). CTAT is funded by the National Cancer Institute Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (NCI ITCR) program.*

### Companies
- [Empirico](https://www.empiricotx.com/) - *We use huge biological datasets, human genetics, and programmable biology to power novel target discovery and development. Our dedicated team of physicians, biologists, chemists, data scientists, and drug developers is working hard to discover a new generation of therapies for patients in need.*
- [The START Center for Cancer Care in San Antonio, TX](https://www.thestartcenter.com/) - *At the START Center, we provide leading-edge cancer treatment backed by a deep commitment to advancing toward a new era in cancer care. Our team strives to offer each patient a comprehensive treatment plan that includes multi-specialty services, genetic profiling of tumors, targeted therapies, state-of-the-art treatment technology, and easy access to clinical research options.*
- [XenoSTART](https://www.xenostart.com/) - *XenoSTART is a global nonclinical oncology contract research organization focused on the development and utilization of patient-derived xenograft models. Founded in 2007, XenoSTART was created in close collaboration with The START Center, an international cancer treatment and research organization. This partnership provides the unique ability to generate clinically-relevant XenoSTART patient-derived xenograft (XPDX) models. Our XPDX models are clinically annotated and include patient treatment history and outcome and are characterized through genomic profiling, histologic analysis, and in vivo drug sensitivity to relevant standards of care. These models may be utilized in the following manner:*
    - *In vivo PK/PD and efficacy studies*
    - *In vivo efficacy panel screens (indication or target focused)*
    - *In licensing of models for internal studies*
    - *Custom model development*
    - *Orthotopic and radiotherapy studies*
    - *Ex vivo and organoid studies*
