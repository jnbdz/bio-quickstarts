- [arriba | GitHub](https://github.com/suhrig/arriba/) - *Fast and accurate gene fusion detection from RNA-Seq data*
- [STAR-Fusion | GitHub](https://github.com/STAR-Fusion/STAR-Fusion) - *STAR-Fusion is a component of the [Trinity Cancer Transcriptome Analysis Toolkit (CTAT)](https://github.com/NCIP/Trinity_CTAT/wiki). STAR-Fusion uses the STAR aligner to identify candidate fusion transcripts supported by Illumina reads. STAR-Fusion further processes the output generated by the STAR aligner to map junction reads and spanning reads to a reference annotation set.*
- [National Cancer Informatics Program | GitHub](https://github.com/NCIP) ([datascience.cancer.gov](http://ncip.nci.nih.gov/)) - *The National Cancer Institute (NCI) coordinates the United States National Cancer Program and is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which is one of eleven agencies that are part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The NCI conducts and supports research, training, health information dissemination, and other activities related to the causes, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer; the supportive care of cancer patients and their families; and cancer survivorship.*
    - [Trinity CTAT | GitHub](https://github.com/NCIP/Trinity_CTAT/) - *The Trinity Cancer Transcriptome Analysis Toolkit (CTAT) aims to provide tools for leveraging RNA-Seq to gain insights into the biology of cancer transcriptomes. Bioinformatics tool support is provided for mutation detection, fusion transcript identification, de novo transcript assembly of cancer-specific transcripts, lincRNA classification, and foreign transcript detection (viruses, microbes). CTAT is funded by the National Cancer Institute Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (NCI ITCR) program.*
